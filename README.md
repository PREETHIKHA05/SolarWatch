# AI-Powered Solar Monitoring System

A comprehensive solar power monitoring system that uses AI to predict power output based on weather conditions and compares it with actual generation to provide intelligent alerts.

## Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Predictions
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to predict solar power output based on weather conditions
- Considers multiple factors: temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, UV index
- Learns from historical data to improve accuracy over time
- Provides confidence scores for predictions

### ‚ö° Real-Time Power Simulation
- Simulates realistic power generation with multiple factors:
  - Solar curve based on time of day
  - Weather impact on actual output
  - Equipment efficiency (inverters, panel degradation, soiling)
  - Maintenance status and random variations

### üö® Intelligent Alert System
- Compares AI predictions with actual output
- Generates alerts for significant deviations
- Four severity levels: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- Root cause analysis (equipment, weather, maintenance issues)
- Alert acknowledgment and tracking

### üìä Comprehensive Dashboard
- Real-time power analysis dashboard
- Visual comparison of predicted vs actual output
- Performance factors breakdown
- Weather condition monitoring
- Alert management panel

### üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Integration
- Stores building data, power history, and alerts
- Scalable cloud database architecture
- Historical data analysis for AI training

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control!**

Copy the `.env.example` file and fill in your actual values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your actual API keys and database connection string.

#### Getting API Keys:

1. **MongoDB Atlas**: 
   - Create account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Create a cluster and get connection string
   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster-url>` with your values

2. **OpenWeatherMap API**:
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Get your free API key from the dashboard

3. **OpenAI API**:
   - Create account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - Generate API key in your dashboard
   - **Note**: This requires a paid OpenAI account for GPT-4 access

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Seed Database
```bash
npm run seed
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
